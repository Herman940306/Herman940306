# Herman Swanepoel | Systems & Reliability Engineer

### 🛠️ Professional Focus: Operational Integrity & High-Stakes Systems
I am a Software Engineer specializing in the design and implementation of high-integrity systems where state-consistency and mathematical precision are mandatory. My engineering approach is defined by **Operational Integrity**: the zero-tolerance for silent failures in mission-critical environments.

### 🔬 Engineering Pedigree: 10 Years of Systems Diagnostics
I bring a decade of experience in **Complex Systems Diagnostics and Workshop Supervision** to software architecture. I specialize in:
* [cite_start]**Root-Cause Analysis:** Translating years of fault-finding on intricate electrical and hydraulic circuits into robust debugging and system recovery logic. [cite: 14, 25, 26, 56]
* [cite_start]**Verified Reliability:** A commitment to extensive automated testing (100+ properties), ensuring that every deployment meets strict "Safety-to-Operate" standards. [cite: 6, 35, 64]
* [cite_start]**Standardization & Auditability:** Implementing rigorous validation and audit trails (JSON/Excel) to maintain perfect systemic transparency. [cite: 13, 62, 65]

### 🚀 Technical Specialization
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Developing standardized "Context Adapters" for AI-agentic systems.
- **Financial Precision:** Engineering ZAR-compliant pacing engines using Banker's Rounding and Decimal math.
- [cite_start]**System Orchestration:** Managing complex data states in IoT and high-concurrency environments. [cite: 17, 18, 26, 63]
